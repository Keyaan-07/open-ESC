# August 17
Today, i learnt about how an ESC works, so basically there is an MCU, and mosfets and their gate drivers, and the MCU switches really fast the MOSFETS which makes then imitate the generation of 3-phase AC, which drives the motor. There is a high side mosfet and a low side mosfet, though i dont still get what these 2 sides means and how is AC made with DC lol.

I think i have decided a few ICs as they are very popular, they are BB21 something MCU, FD6288 three phase driver. BSC007N04LS6 MOSFET was selected by me as i liked it so much on LCSC.
